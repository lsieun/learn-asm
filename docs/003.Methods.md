# Methods

ASM provides **three core components** based on the `MethodVisitor` API to generate(从无到有的生成新的) and transform(修改已有的) methods:

- The `ClassReader` class parses the content of compiled methods and calls the corresponding methods on the `MethodVisitor` objects returned by the `ClassVisitor` passed as argument to its `accept` method.
- The `ClassWriter`’s `visitMethod` method returns an implementation of the `MethodVisitor` interface that builds compiled methods directly in binary form.
- The `MethodVisitor` class delegates all the method calls it receives to another `MethodVisitor` instance. It can be seen as an event filter.
