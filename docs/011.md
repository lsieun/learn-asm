# Tree

The conclusion is that **the tree API is generally used for transformations that cannot be implemented in one pass with the core API**. But there are of course exceptions. For example an obfuscator cannot be implemented in one pass, because you cannot transform classes before the mapping from original to obfuscated names is fully constructed, which requires to parse all classes<sub>进行obfuscator，使用core API，只进行一次转换，是无法完成的</sub>. But the tree API is not a good solution either, because it would require keeping in memory the object representation of all the classes to obfuscate<sub>使用tree API，虽然能一次完成，但需要大量的内存，因此也不是一个好办法</sub>. In this case it is better to use the core API with two passes: one to compute the mapping between original and obfuscated names (a simple hash table that requires much less memory than a full object representation of all the classes), and one to transform the classes based on this mapping.

## Transforming methods

Transforming a method with **the tree API** simply consists in modifying the fields of a `MethodNode` object, and in particular the `instructions` list. Although this list can be modified in arbitray ways, **a common pattern is to modify it while iterating over it**.
