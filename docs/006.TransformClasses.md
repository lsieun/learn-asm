# Transforming classes

So far the `ClassReader` and `ClassWriter` components were used alone.

- The events were produced “by hand” and consumed directly by a `ClassWriter` or,
- symetrically, they were produced by a `ClassReader` and consumed “by hand”, i.e. by a custom `ClassVisitor` implementation.

Things start to become really interesting when these components are used together. **The first step** is to direct **the events** produced by a `ClassReader` to a `ClassWriter`. The result is that the class parsed by the class reader is reconstructed by the class writer:

```java
//（1）构建ClassReader
byte[] b1 = ...;
ClassReader cr = new ClassReader(b1);

//（2）构建ClassWriter
ClassWriter cw = new ClassWriter(0);

//（3）两者进行结合
cr.accept(cw, 0);

//（4）重新生成Class
byte[] b2 = cw.toByteArray(); // b2 represents the same class as b1
```

This is not really interesting in itself (there are easier ways to copy a byte array!), but wait. **The next step** is to introduce a `ClassVisitor` between **the class reader** and **the class writer**:

```java
//（1）构建ClassReader
byte[] b1 = ...;
ClassReader cr = new ClassReader(b1);

//（2）构建ClassWriter
ClassWriter cw = new ClassWriter(0);

//（3）串连ClassVisitor
// cv forwards all events to cw
ClassVisitor cv = new ClassVisitor(ASM4, cw) { };

//（4）两者进行结合
cr.accept(cv, 0);

//（5）重新生成Class
byte[] b2 = cw.toByteArray(); // b2 represents the same class as b1
```

The result does not change, however, because the `ClassVisitor` event filter does not filter anything. But it is now sufficient to filter some events, by overriding some methods, in order to be able to transform a class. For example, consider the following `ClassVisitor` subclass:

```java
public class ChangeVersionAdapter extends ClassVisitor {
    public ChangeVersionAdapter(ClassVisitor cv) {
        super(ASM4, cv);
    }

    @Override
    public void visit(int version, int access, String name,
        String signature, String superName, String[] interfaces) {
        cv.visit(V1_5, access, name, signature, superName, interfaces);
    }
}
```
